# Personal Scripts

This directory holds helper scripts that are tightly coupled to my local environment and workflow. Paths, credentials, or assumptions baked into them are unlikely to make sense elsewhere.

If you are browsing this repo for reusable tooling, start with `bin/` insteadâ€”anything under `bin/personal/` is intentionally one-off and maintained only for my own setup.
