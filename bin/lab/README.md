# 🧪 The lab

The `lab/` directory is where rough ideas and half-finished tools live.
It’s a sandbox for experiments, sketches, and scraps that might evolve into something useful later.

## What belongs here

- **Work in progress** — scripts actively being shaped or tested.
- **One-offs & experiments** — quick utilities, often AI-generated, that might get refined someday.
- **Placeholders** — empty shells created with `script-scaffold`, usually with only a description filled in.
- **Your mom**

## Naming conventions

| Prefix      | Meaning                                              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `wip-*`     | Active work in progress                              |
| `proto-*`   | Prototype or early proof-of-concept                  |
| `exp-*`     | Experimental or exploratory script                   |
| `tmp-*`     | Temporary or quick test                              |
| `legacy-*`  | Deprecated but potentially useful reference          |
| `archive-*` | Fully retired or obsolete scripts kept for posterity |

## Notes

Nothing in here is expected to be stable or clean — it’s the workshop.
When a script feels solid, **promote it to `bin/`** and give it proper documentation.
